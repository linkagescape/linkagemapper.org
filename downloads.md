### What's new in Version 3.1.0

- Updated code to run in latest versions of ArcPro, versions 3.x (Python changed the syntax of time.)
- Update that makes it possible to run tools in batch from Python scripts. Helpful for testing.
- Fix to the Coarsen Raster Sizes utility to allow it to work with rasters that have file extensions not just raster grids.
- Fixed a bug in Pinchpoint mapper that arises for certain edge cases.
- Further refined the use of (time) in ArcPro, versions 3.x and higher

Thank you to Darren Kavanagh for coding these improvements, and to Fred Watson for finding and sharing the initial solution to the ArcPro 3.0 bug.
